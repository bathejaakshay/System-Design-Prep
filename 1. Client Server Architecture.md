## Key points

Server has two things: logic and data

**Thin Client**: When processing is very light at client side. e.g Streaming applications, E-commerce sites.
**Thick Client**: When processing heavy at client side. e.g video editing softwares, gaming apps.

Architecture:

**2 Tier**: For light weight websites for small business when logic and data can be handled by the single server itself. Client-Server

**3 Tier**: When data is relatively large and there is need of separate DB server. We break Server into logic and data. Client-Logic-Data

**n Tier**: When data is huge and computation is huge and require data securing. We multiple components like Cache between logic and Data, Load balancer between Different logic machines.
